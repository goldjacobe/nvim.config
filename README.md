Hi, this is my Neovim configuration!

After relating to and responding to the auther of this [blog post](https://gyydin.mataroa.blog/blog/neovim-is-driving-me-crazy-but-i-cant-stop/) with a list of resources I found helpful as I ease my own way into Neovim, I decided I might as well put the list here too.

Some of the standard ones:
[Prime 0 to LSP video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)
[Kickstart's init.lua](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/blob/master/init.lua)

I realized that Packer is old news, so decided to use Lazy as my plugin manager, but I left a bunch of Prime's maps in because I find them cool/useful.
And my .`config/nvim` folder is still set up like Prime's (with all my configuration in `after/plugin`).

I also watched the first bit of teej and bashbunni's [neovim series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep05UYkc6wTWlugE_9Lj6JlLpvSBbkZ_), still a few more of these videos to go because they are quite long.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8) helped to get another perspective on what setting up from scratch can look like.

I found a couple other Youtubers really helpful for learning about more useful plugins:
[DevOps Toolbox](https://www.youtube.com/@devopstoolbox)
[Cantu Codes](https://www.youtube.com/@cantucodes)

And this [repository](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) has been a helpful resource for finding plugins as well.

Check out my `lazy.nvim` file to see the full list of plugins :)
